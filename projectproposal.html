    <h2>Project Proposal</h2>
    <hr />
    <ul>
      <p><li class="question">What is your website about?</li></p>
      My website will be about a learning material of basic Japanese for
      foreigners. It will contain basic Japanese character and useful Japanese
      phrase in various daily situation. I am thinking to add small trivia or
      cultural difference which foreigners may face when they go to Japan.

      <p><li class="question">What is the objective of your website?</li></p>
      The objective of this website is to teach and show Japanese culture
      through language. As an exchange student and representative from Japan, my
      goal is to not only learn US culture but also teach about my country.

      <p><li class="question">Who is your target audience?</li></p>
      My target audience will be anyone who is interested in Japan and learning
      Japanese. I hope I can give incentives to know more about Japan for those
      who are not familiar with Japan.

      <p><li class="question">What content do you plan to include?</li></p>
