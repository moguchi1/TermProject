        Japan is a great country. There are so many great food, places for
        sightseeing, and enjoyments. Japan is known for its politeness, great
        hospitality and clean country so it is must-visit country for
        foreigners. However, there is one big worry when visiting Japan;
        culture. Visitors may feel hard in Japan because people do not speak
        English in general, and they may also feel weird since there are certain
        manners and rules you should follow.

      <h4>Who am I?</h4>
      <p>
        I am attending Babson College from a Japanese university as an exchange
        student. As a representative from Japan, I would like to not only gain
        the US culture but also give fundamental Japanese to foreigners.
