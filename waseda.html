          <p>
            Waseda University is often ranked best private university in Japan, with the rival of Keio University.
            Waseda University was founded in 1882 by Okuma Shigenobu. Okuma was the
            8th prime minister in 1898. Kuma in Japanese means bear, so Waseda's
            mascout is Waseda Bear. There are several divisons in Waseda but faculty
            of political science and economics are well known.

          <p><i>If international students come to Waseda University, they are likely to study at School of International
              Liberal Studies (SILS) is the school for international students.</i> </p>

        <br>
        <div id="sils">
          <h4>SILS</h4>
          <p>About one third of students in SILS are international students. There are several study plans, and SP3 is
            the plan for exchange students. What's unique about SILS is that SP1 students who tend to be Japanese
            students require to go 1 year study abroad to graduate (This requirement may be modified due to COVID.)</p>
          <p>There are many courses students can take and most of them are conducted in English. There are many Japanese
            classes for different levels. Thus, students who are not confident in Japanese or study Japanese can take
            such classes. There are 7 clusters of courses, and here are lists.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Life, Environment, Matter and Information</li>
            <li>Philosophy, Religion and History</li>
            <li>Economy and Business</li>
            <li>Governance, Peace, Human Rights and International Relations</li>
            <li>Communication</li>
            <li>Expression</li>
            <li>Culture, Mind and Body, Community</li>
          </ol>
          You can, of course, take classes from other schools so there are variety of subjects you can study and
          concentrate!!
